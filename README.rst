python-gotalk
=============

:Author: Greg Taylor
:License: BSD
:Status: Early development
:Gotalk Version: 01

python-gotalk aspires to be a Python implementation of the Gotalk_ protocol.
It is currently in the early goings, so you probably don't want to use this
for anything serious.

As of this second, this module contains everything needed to form or parse
gotalk messages. Unlike the Go reference implementation, we don't have any
convenience stuff to tie it all together and make it work... yet.

As noted above, python-gotalk currently supports only protocol version 01.
Given that gotalk 01 is still evolving, this is a bit of a moving target
currently.

Coming soon, hopefully!
